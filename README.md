# jQuery Practice
Playground for jQuery practice and projects.

This practice code is from a Udemy course called [jQuery in Action: Build 20 jQuery Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/jquery-web-development-made-easy/)

After forking, make sure to run `npm install jQuery` before you begin.

When creating a new HTML page, make sure to import jQuery in the Head of the document.  An example would look like:

`<script src="../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>`

NOTE: The `/ajax` folder is purely code.  It does not connect to an acutal server, so you will not receive any working data.
